		<div class="collapse-content text-sm">
			A tracking number or ID is a combination of numbers and possibly letters that uniquely
			identifies your shipment for national or international tracking.
			<!-- Usually, the shipper or
			online shop is able to provide the tracking number or ID. If you have ordered a product in an
			online shop, the confirmation email or shipment tracking notification often contains the
			tracking number or ID. If not, please contact your shipper or online shop. -->

		<div class="collapse-title font-semibold">When will my tracking information appear?</div>
		<div class="collapse-content text-sm">
			Tracking events usually appear 24-48 hours after receiving the Track and Trace ID. In general,
			once the shipment has reached our facility, a tracking event will appear.

				If I do not have my tracking number, is it still possible to track my shipment?
			</div>
			<div class="collapse-content text-sm">
				If you do not have a tracking number, we advise you to contact your shipper. However, if you
				have other shipping reference numbers, they may work using shipment tracking systems of the
				specific business unit in charge of the shipment (for example: DHL Express or DHL Freight).
